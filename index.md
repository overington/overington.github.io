# Hey, I'm Samuel

Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Dimension Studio](https://dimensionstudio.co/), focusing on novel ML techniques for virtual production. Outside of work, I explore the intersection of technology and art, and currently working on a project for [Link in my Bio Productions](https://www.linkinmybioproductions.com/). I'm passionate about pushing technological boundaries and always open to new collaborations.
