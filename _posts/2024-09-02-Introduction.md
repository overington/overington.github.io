## What am I trying to achieve by writing this blog?

- I am always learning, and here is a place where I can organise that - a home.
- I think that writing is a good way of exploring what I have already learned, helping to solidify and make connections between ideas.
- Sometimes, I think that I understand a concept, but it's not untill I am trying to explain it, that I realise that I don't have a good grasp on what is actually happening.
- Caffeine is an inspiration.
