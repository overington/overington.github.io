  I’m a software engineer at Dimension Studio, focusing on novel ML techniques
  for virtual production. Outside of work, I explore the intersection of
  technology and art, creating projects for Link in my Bio. I'm passionate about
  pushing technological boundaries and always open to new collaborations.
