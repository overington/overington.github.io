# TODO:

- [x] main navigation problem:
    Main navigation link will add the current page to the end of current url, I want it to be the root url.
    To fix this, I need to add a `baseurl` to the config file, and then use that in the navigation links.

## Hero Post fixes:
- [ ] rearrange hero post so media gets displayed on right, and text on left.
    or show hero image as background to hero header
- [ ] add description text to hero post

## Post page:
