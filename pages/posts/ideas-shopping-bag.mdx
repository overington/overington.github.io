## What is it? (short-form)

An object carry utility that sometimes goes into fashion. It is meant to group
physical things together and make it easier for a user to carry multiple object
which might otherwise be difficult to bring on their person, or hold.

## Why am I interested in thinking about it eg technique, creativity... (optional)

There is one on my desk.

## How does it exist?

It often serves two major purposes; utility & fashion:

  - **Fashion**: because it becomes like a large canvas , the design of a bag
  in colour and visual appeal has become a way of discerning the user from
  other users. This exists as much in the users mind as it does the gaze of the
  viewer.
  - **Utility**: Since it's inception it consists of a material which brings
  the objects together, and often has two handles to make it easier to use.

It has been known to be made from plant fibres, animal hides and plastics.
 

## What are some current questions or obstructions that it faces?

Today - many are made from plastic or a compound that takes a long time to
break-down. The reason for this is the trade-off between material strength and
durability. 

### Degradation after use:

 - To begin with, the materials used for creating a bag were chosen for their
 durability, with a bag having a larger re-usage factor. This is due to it
 being an expensive tool to craft, and so as so, was designed with durability
 in mind.

 - As manufacturing and industrialisation happened, a bag tended towards single
 use (or sometimes even half use, if you think of things like double-bagging).
 
 - Now, producers of shopping bags (and bags in general), are returning to
 a bag which has a long life and is more durable. This is brought on by waste
 usage, planet health.
